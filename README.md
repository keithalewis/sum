# Simple Universal Model

Let \(\Omega\) be the set of possible outcomes and \(\mathcal{A}_t\) be the information available at time \(t\).

Let \(I\) be the set of market instruments and \(X_t, C_t\colon\mathcal{A}_t \to \mathbb{R}^I\) 
be their price and cash flow processes, respectively.

A trading strategy is an increasing sequence of stopping times \((\tau_j)\)
and number of shares to trade \(\Gamma_j\colon\mathcal{A}_{\tau_j} \to \mathbb{R}^I\).
The position at time \(t\) is \(\Delta_t = \sum_{\tau_j < t} \Gamma_j\)
where \(\Gamma_s = \Gamma_j\) if \(s = \tau_j\) for some \(j\) and 0 otherwise.

Define the value at time \(t\) of a trading strategy by
\(V_t = (\Delta_t + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_t\) 
and the amounts generated by the strategy \(A_t = \Delta_t\cdot C_t - \Gamma_t\cdot X_t\).

Every arbitrage-free model has the form \(X_t D_t = M_t - \sum_{s < t} C_s D_s|_{\mathcal{A}_t}\), 
where \(M_t\) is a vector-valued martingale measure and \(D_t\) is the stochastic discount.
